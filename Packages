Description: Make the official Reddit app in the App Store better to use. This tweak was originally developed by Alakazard. The source code was given to me, as he'd like to step away from the jailbreak community. I have not touched this tweak at all since he has given it to me. I apologize that some features may not work as Reddit updates their app. I hope to update this app in the feature. Sorry, and thank you.

Description: Cydia repository on your device! If you need to install a package, and it's not on Cydia, and when you try installing it through Filza, it's not working, you can add it to your local repo. After installing this package, you can take any Debian packages you have, and drop them into /var/mobile/repo/debs then open Terminal and run "repo/pack" without the quotations marks. You can add a repo icon by adding a 120 by 120 image called "CydiaIcon.png" (without quotation marks) to the repo folder. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to contact me. I'm listed as both the author and maintainer of this tweak. If email isn't convenient for you, my other points of contact can be found here: https://ipadkid358.github.io/contact.html
