										<h1>What you can do</h1>
									</header>
									<p>We urge you to oppose President Trump's nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to serve as administrator of the United States EPA. Pruitt's record and statements on climate change and environmental protection are deeply troubling, and should disqualify him from leadership of the EPA.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Attorney General Pruitt has been hostile to the EPA and its mission of protecting human health and the environment. From mocking climate change science as "speculative guesswork" to leading the charge to kill the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan and his many lawsuits to block the agency's efforts to protect air, water and our environment, Pruitt has made it clear that he's the wrong choice to enforce our nations' bedrock environmental laws and ensure that the EPA has the budget, staff, and resources to protect our health and the environment.</p>

<p>Please vote against Scott Pruitt's nomination, and urge President Trump to replace him with a nominee who is better suited for this critically important leadership position.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h4>Please call your senators and address the following issues:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The holeman rule - where any civil servant that speaks out can have their salary reduced to 1 dollar</li>
<br>
<li>Oppose the repeal of Obamacare in its entirety, imagine all those chemotherapy treatments that will be interrupted</li€
<br>
<li>Making them take a stand against Trump's sidelining of CNN. Definitely goes against 1st amendment</li>
<br>
<li>Voting against Cruz bill to label Muslim brotherhood a terrorist organization. If they do, they will then allege ties to all of the institutions we have worked so hard to build, after that they will squash our civil rights with no institutions remaining to support us</li>
</ul>

<h4>Emailing The White House</h4>

Please write to www.whitehouse.gov/contact

I am outraged that you have issued executive memoranda clearing the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines with no input from the American public. I urge you to reverse course on these dangerous and dirty fossil fuel projects.  

These pipelines are vehemently opposed by the locals and native communities whose land they would cross and whose water they would pollute. When the American people elected you as president, they didn't vote for dirty water, dirty air or more climate chaos. 

These pipelines are not in our national interest and I, along with millions of others, will fight you every step of the way if your administration moves forward with them.
